## Cost Recovery and Crowding in Public Transport
## A Welfare Analysis of Bogotá’s TransMilenio
This project analyzes the trade-offs between fare levels, crowding, and cost recovery in Bogotá’s TransMilenio BRT system using a welfare economics framework. The analysis evaluates how different pricing and demand scenarios affect passenger welfare and operator cost recovery, with implications for public transport financing in rapidly growing Latin American cities.

## Data & methods:
- Passenger demand and service data for Bogotá’s TransMilenio
- Welfare analysis incorporating crowding disutility
- Scenario-based simulations of fare and demand changes
- Quantitative analysis conducted in R

## Policy Relevance:
Public transport systems in middle-income cities face persistent trade-offs between fare affordability, service quality, and financial sustainability. This analysis provides evidence on how pricing and crowding dynamics affect welfare outcomes, supporting policy discussions on subsidy design, fare setting, and service provision in BRT systems.

## Outputs
Planned outputs include:
- Welfare estimates under alternative fare and demand scenarios  
- Cost recovery indicators for TransMilenio operations  
- Sensitivity analysis of crowding disutility assumptions  

Figures and tables will be added as the analysis progresses.

## Status

This project is part of ongoing academic research and is under active development. Results are preliminary.
